  <h4> Get Followers On Facebook Using Termux Only ! </h4>

##

### What is Like4Book?
[**Like4Book**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/Like4Book) is a tool that can be used to gain followers on Facebook.

You can get 2 credits every time you complete a mission!

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/rozhakid). Then you enter some basic commands below!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/Like4Book
$ cd "Like4Book"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/Like4Book" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### Why didn't the followers arrive?
- Your Facebook account does not have a follow button, make sure only the follow button is visible to the public.
- Maybe you entered the wrong Facebook account profile link.
- Facebook accounts must have public settings enabled for the follow button to appear.
- Maybe it was Like4Like's fault because they didn't process your order.

### Failed to get credit?
- Maybe this is the fault of the likr4like website because it doesn't process the mission.
- The mission to be completed is temporarily unavailable.
- Maybe your Facebook account is restricted for a few days so you can't follow other accounts.

### Why login failed?
- Maybe your Facebook account is locked or hit by a checkpoint.
- Facebook account or Like4Like account is logged out.
- Maybe the like4like website is affected by cloudflare.
- Maybe you entered the wrong like4like cookies or Facebook cookies.
- Like4like account cookies or Facebook account cookies have expired.

### Why are Facebook accounts restricted?
- Use security like phone numbers, email, and two-factor authentication to reduce spam.
- I recommend an online account in the browser you use.
- You must use a delay of more than 2 minutes to be safe and not easily blocked.

### What is recommended?
- Use the Via Browser application to get Facebook cookies or Like4Like cookies.
- Use additional security such as two-factor authentication.
- You have to use a fake account or a new account to carry out the mission.

### Why are followers dropping?
The main reason your followers drop is because they stop following you or Facebook deletes followers on your Facebook account.
